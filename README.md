# Sales Data Analysis and Forecasting

## Project Description
This project performs a comprehensive analysis on historical sales data, focusing on customer segmentation, sales trends, and future sales forecasting. Using Python and various data analysis techniques, the project extracts valuable insights to inform business strategies. 

## Project Structure
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all data analysis steps, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, and forecasting.
- `data.csv`: Sample dataset used for analysis (upload to the same directory as the notebook to ensure smooth execution).
- `forecasted_sales.csv`: Exported file with forecasted sales data for the next 12 months, based on ARIMA modeling.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Load and prepare the dataset, handling missing values and anomalies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze trends, top-selling products, sales by country, and peak times of sales activity.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Apply RFM analysis to classify customers into meaningful segments.
4. **Market Basket Analysis**: Use association rules to identify commonly purchased product pairs.
5. **Sales Forecasting**: Build a time-series forecasting model (ARIMA) to predict future sales.

## Requirements
Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn mlxtend statsmodels pmdarima
```

If using Google Colab, ensure you run `!pip install` commands within the notebook for compatibility.

## Instructions to Run
1. **Set up the environment**: Install the libraries listed above if they’re not already installed.
2. **Run the notebook**: Execute each cell sequentially in the `notebook.ipynb` file.
3. **Review Outputs**: Key outputs include visualizations, customer segmentation tables, and a forecasted sales file (`forecasted_sales.csv`).

## Results
- **Customer Segmentation**: Key customer groups are identified for targeted marketing.
- **Forecasting**: Future sales are predicted to assist in inventory planning and marketing.
